Blockchain can be derived as a peer-to-peer distributed ledger that is secure and used for recording transactions. It serves as a platform where people are allowed to carry out transactions without depending on any trusted arbitrator.

Key Features of Blockchain:

Peer-to-Peer Network: Individuals can directly communicate with each other as peers with no intermediation.
Distributed: Each individual will have a copy of the transaction that takes place in the network.
Ledger Technology: Every piece of information is stored in a chronological fashion like a ledger.
Decentralized: No need for a centralized authority to monitor as everything is distributed across a network.
Immutable: Once information is added to the blockchain, it cannot be changed or removed.
Transparent: Every individual is timely updated and will have access to the information stored on a blockchain.

To sum up, read on the advantages of decentralization.

No single point of failure
Total disintermediation
Censorship resistance
Improved security
High availability
Greater transparency

Blockchain as Database
Blockchain is an append-only data store
It also verifies the information prior to adding them to the chain.
In the blockchain, the network participants come together and build a consensus within themselves checking the authenticity of the transaction or information. Consensus acts as a checkpoint of information prior to adding them to a blockchain database.

Blockchain can limit your loss by acting as a trusted source of information that can be verified and that cannot be changed.

Trust comes when you see your information stored is intact. Verification comes when you have access to your information. Blockchain establishes both Trust and Verifiability. Let's see how it does.

It is the art of Cryptography that sticks the blocks together and makes them secure and tamper-resistant. Each block is chained to the previous block by embedding the block with a cryptographic piece of information from the previous block.

This is Cryptography. "Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries."

The hashing algorithm has certain characteristics.

One-way: While it is easy to calculate the hash of data, it isn't possible to decode the original data from a hash. For example, we can make juice out of the fruit but not fruit from the juice.
Deterministic: A hashing algorithm always produces the same output for the same set of inputs.
Avalanche Effect: Any small change in the input data would produce an unpredictably different hash as output. As you have seen in the experiment.
Withstand Collisions: No two pieces of data can produce the same hash. The collisions are unlikely to happen.

There are several instances where a blockchain depends on hashing. To cite a few: creating transaction hash, generating Merkle tree, creating block hash, creating addresses, linking blocks to form a chain.
